# Matrix-Computation-with-SIMD-Optimization-in-C
A high-performance C program that computes the sum of element-wise products between rows of two matrices using **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** optimization via SSE intrinsics. This project demonstrates low-level performance tuning, memory alignment, and precise timing measurement.
